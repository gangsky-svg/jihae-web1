<h5>HI GUYS~</h5>
<u>My name is ji-hae.</u>

<u>I'm 15 years old.</u>
<u>I'm a woman.I'm a middle student.I'm from Korea.</u>
<br><br>I want to be a developer.
Because it would be very interesting.
<br><br>So I am learning about coding while watching YouTube.
 I'll do the tune.
<br><br>Be sure! I am currently attending Gokseong Middle School.
The opening of school is being postponed continuously because of a disease called coronavirus.
So I think it is good but also annoying.

 But since I became a middle school student,
 I decided to think about it by myself because I think I need to pay more attention to my future.
 I started looking for a job related to math because I like math and I think I am better than other subjects,
 and I participated well in the career program at school and became a banker in my first year of middle school.
But in the early 8th grade, I pondered more.
Today is the fourth industrial revolution and I am interested in it job.
Getting a lot of information on YouTube, I finally made up my mind to become a developer today, March 6, 2020.
So I try to learn coding hard. I can do it!
